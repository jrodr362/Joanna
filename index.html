        <p class="lead mb-4">   My name is Joanna Rodriguez and I am currently a student from the University of California, Riverside and I want to major in Operations and Supply Chain Management. I have worked in the logistics field in different ways. Such as in managing customer service and managing money when I used to work with my mother in a food business. During this experience when working with my mother I was able to use my communication skills with people. I was able to use my Spanish speaking skills when talking to customers. I had an internship and worked before and after school, during my high school years with the attendance counselors as their executive assistant. I have also been the executive assistant for the JROTC Program in my high school as well. While working with both jobs, I was able to gain collaboration skills, managing paperwork, and multitasking skills. During the JROTC Program, I was learned leadership skills by leading the class and taking attendance and guiding the class with instructions for the younger students. I also lead the parade every year for the homecoming parad. I got the opportunity to also lead during high school graduations for community service by leading the parents and the graduates to their seats and making sure the ceremony went as planned and organized. The JROTC Program and the internship when working with the college counselors, I was able also to learn Microsoft Office by using the computer to manage files online for every duty I was assigned to do.<br><br>

            Since I have learned these skills I have strengthen in these skills and I can be able to use them for my furture career. I have also joined college programs such as the USC Upward Bound Program which also taught me to multitask throughout my high school years and to take responsibilities in being able to manage my time by waking up early every Saturday and when I took college classes every summer during my high school years. The other program was called One Voice which I joined during my junior year of high school and I was able to take lots of responsibilities as well by keeping up with college applications and my school work at the same time. When learning to manage my time wisely during this program, I was able to visit different private liberal art colleges around the U.S.<br><br>

            All of these experiences have made me strengthen in these skills and be prepared when going into my future career and now I want to be able to experience these skills furthermore throughout my present career that I have been able to accomplish during my high school and current college year. I want to be able to experience these skills first hand while joining a company in my field. I have also developed other skills throughout my first year of college when taking college courses on the career that I chose which are coding, data analytics, manufacturing, economics, and marketing. So, I feel that I can be able to make your company become as successful as possible when taking my skills into consideration. Thank you for your time and I would like to further reach out to your company by having an interview if possible.
